        <message>Humans need standards and shared reasons for acting.  Most societies have ideas of right and wrong and good and bad based on shared meaning.  These often overlap, in the form of respect for the individual, family, and community. as well as basic moral precepts like its wrong to kill.  Ultimately, lack of an objective standard is not mutually exclusive. with meaningful value systems and judgments. That is all I have to say about that.</message>
